# python-robotics-learning

This repo tracks my journey learning **Python for Robotics** step by step.  
Iâ€™ve completed Codecademy JavaScript and am now transitioning into Python.  

## ðŸ“… Phase 1 â€“ Python Basics (Weeks 1â€“2)
- FreeCodeCamp Python for Beginners (4 hours).  
- HackerRank practice problems (easy level).  
- Focus: variables, loops, conditionals, functions, lists, dictionaries, file I/O.  

## ðŸ“… Phase 2 â€“ NumPy & Matplotlib
- Learn numerical computing & plotting.  
- Project: simulate PID controller in Python and plot results.  

## ðŸ“… Phase 3 â€“ OpenCV (Computer Vision)
- Object detection, edge tracking, basic vision pipelines.  
- Project: detect and track a coloured object with webcam.  

## ðŸ“… Phase 4 â€“ ROS2 Basics
- Learn ROS2 concepts: nodes, topics, publishers, subscribers.  
- Project: simulate robot navigation in Gazebo.  

## ðŸ“… Phase 5 â€“ Final Integrated Project
- Combine OpenCV + NumPy + ROS2 in a robotics simulation.  
- Portfolio-ready project.

## âœ… Current Status
- Repo created and folders set up.  
- First script (`hello.py`) added in Week1_Basics.  
- Next step: Begin **FreeCodeCamp Python for Beginners** and commit practice scripts here.
